# flashcard app
fullstack project. C# .NET, MVC, SSR. 
User Accounts &amp; Profiles, Flashcard Sets, Favourites System, Friends System, Feed ("Flow") Page.

<hr>

an app that people could create, put into their favourites, and share flashcard sets (publicly -to everyone-, with specific friends, or all friends)

profile page (password change, some profile edit parts)
* my fav sets
* my sets

my friends page (including sending friend request and seeing requests)
* my friends (public or open to me) sets

something like "flow" in instagram/x or other social platforms
* every set would have tags, when i create or fav sets, that kind of sets would appear to me more.


### TODO (a bit extra)
* Admin panel to manage tags and users
* Export set to PDF or CSV
* Notifications (new friend request, someone liked your set, etc.)
* Flashcard "Study Mode" with one-by-one flip animation
* Spaced repetition tracking (basic implementation)
* REST API for future mobile app
